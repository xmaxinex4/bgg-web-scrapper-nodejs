Everyone is given a character, and whether you end up playing a Lord, a Lady, a dustman or a horse meat wholesaler, you will encounter more skulduggery, adultery, coercion and crime than in the entire works of Jilly Cooper, Joanna Trollope and Dick Francis. &#10; Lady Amanda Cudham, founder and chairwoman of the club, has died in tragic and mysterious circumstances. Our plot unfolds during a meeting of the club, where members decide who should replace Amanda as chairwoman.&#10;&#10;Invitations are sent out in advance, so everyone knows which character they are playing and understands some of the background. The plot is usually run over a meal and, as well as solving the murder, characters are given other objectives to achieve. Some, for instance, want to become the next chairwoman. Some have guilty secrets to keep hidden. Some have scores to settle. And everyone is keen to get rich, buy and sell a few horses, and place a few bets before the Race of the Season (the Isle of Man Handicap) gets underway.&#10;&#10;No knowledge of horses is needed to run or enjoy this plot. How much guests become involved is up to each individual but, in our own experience, even the quiet ones become utterly caught up in the action.&#10;&#10;Towards the end, a live commentary of the Isle of Man Handicap is read out and winning bets are paid out. The guest playing Inspector Dawdley then gets everyone into teams and invites each of them to put forward their solution. Finally, Dawdley reads out the correct solution, arrests the murderer and brings a fun-filled, highly entertaining and irresistibly silly occasion to a close.&#10;&#10;Word of warning:&#10;&#10;The behavior of some of the characters in &quot;Cudham Riding Club&quot; is appalling: they take drugs, they gamble, they cheat on their partners, they kill. As a result, we consider the plot to be suitable only for people aged 15 and over.&#10;&#10;","minPlayers":14,"maxPlayers":40,"minPlayTime":240,"maxPlayTime":240,"minAge":18,"categoriesAndMechanics":["Murder/Mystery","Party Game","Role Playing","Storytelling"],"rating":0,"complexity":0,"urlThumb":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/rt-tlqKN3CALO7kUdwN9_g__thumb/img/yLicpuuyJCqhcbE57-Uys39AQTc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic7893342.jpg","urlImage":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/rt-tlqKN3CALO7kUdwN9_g__original/img/XLsjCBu7qfUqNw9cEMcqTjlanrE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic7893342.jpg"},{"bggId":"23152","name":"The Cottonfield Kidnapping!","description":"A trip to the Old South might be more your style and there's been a kidnapping at Helta Skelta Delta Plantation, in Pippy, Mississippi.&#10;&#10;The date is September 27, 1861 and way down yonder in the land of cotton plans are in progress for the annual &quot;Cotton Picker's Cotton Pickin Picnic&quot;.

You can only step on a square if it has a tile on it. You can step on any tile, even if it was made by another player.&#10;4. If you step on an empty square, or the tile you're standing on breaks, then you &quot;fall in&quot; and have to swim back to the nearest tile.&#10;5. Each empty square that either borders a tile or the starting edge of the game board has a question visible on it. The questions are very simple and have single answers, such as &quot;why does water flow downhill?&quot; or &quot;why can light pass through glass?&quot; or &quot;what is heat?&quot;&#10;6. The only way to make new tiles is by making-up an answer to the question.&#10;7. A tile will only float if you can verify the answer with a reproducible test.&#10;8. A tile can only be broken by proving the answer is wrong with a reproducible test.&#10;9. A test can't break a tile if its results can't be reproduced, a tile can't float if the verifying test's results can't be reproduced.&#10;10. If a tile is broken, then all tiles ahead of it that cannot be connected back to the starting edge by another continuous series of tiles will be broken as well.&#10;11.

For one night we will return to the good old days when Elvis was at the top of the charts. Sock hops, hula-hoops and poodles were radioactive. Getting pinned meant something altogether different than it does these days.&#10;&#10;The Class of '57 was written to be a little different than the rest of our games. First of all the 10 or 12 main suspects are all couples very much in love. Couples will be working together at times to achieve goals. They may have some secrets from each other, but overall they will be working to protect each other. This gives the game a romantic flavor. This murder mystery game is what we would call a 'clean' game. There are no affairs &amp; people are basically good. This game is great for church groups and others who are worried about the possibility of offending guests. It can also be used for older teen groups!&#10;&#10;Another difference is that the murder happens before the game. Being a couples murder mystery we felt it would be too complicated to murder them both or only one. That is not to say that there won't be more murders during the evening. Those tend to happen in our games since we provide a lot of intrigue outside of the murder itself.&#10;&#10;The 12 player version has 6 couples and we include our 2 Extra Character Packets to expand the game up to 32. The Extra Character Packets add a little quirky flavor to the party, but not all of these 20 extra characters may be suitable for conservative groups.

It is similar in play and design as Senet.&#10;&#10;The object is to be the first player to bear off all 5 of his pieces, by landing them precisely on the last square.&#10;Once successfully borne off, a piece plays no further part in the game.&#10;&#10;PLAYER TURNS&#10;The players throw once each alternately, and move a single piece by the appropriate number of positions. A&#10;move must be made, and made in full. If no move is possible, then the turn is forfeit (passes to the other&#10;player). When forfeiting a throw, the opponent has the option of adding the forfeited throw to his own.&#10;&#10;HOW TO MOVE THE PIECES&#10;Each player enters the pieces onto the board from his reserve and moves them as follows:&#10;Pieces move forward only. As pieces reach the last square (by exact throw), they bear off; be the first to&#10;bear off all your pieces and you win! The marked squares give you an extra turn; when you land on them, you&#10;get to throw the sticks and go again. Only one piece may occupy any given square; if you land on an opposing&#10;piece, it is removed &mdash;sent back to the player&rsquo;s reserve.&#10;To bring your first piece on, you must first throw a 4 or a 6; when that happens, you throw again and move&#10;the piece in by that amount. The remaining pieces can be brought in on any throw. Waiting for that initial&#10;throw of 4 or 6, particularly while the opponent is already moving, can be quite frustrating, so it is an acceptable&#10;variant to forego that rule entirely.&#10;&#10;","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":2,"minPlayTime":30,"maxPlayTime":30,"minAge":10,"categoriesAndMechanics":["Ancient","Dice","Roll / Spin and Move"],"rating":1.5,"complexity":0,"urlThumb":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/mROruCfwCYRmYmXMI4KS9Q__thumb/img/Rb9Es2sP1R3ADbigo3JbXJ5RrZk=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic122653.jpg","urlImage":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/mROruCfwCYRmYmXMI4KS9Q__original/img/qCNKDIsQSNj1PEJiJvIInI7Fv7I=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic122653.jpg"},{"bggId":"23216","name":"Tusk","description":"Tusk is a beer-and-pretzels hunting game using 15mm miniatures on a terrain board (conversion to other scales is not difficult.) &#10;Players represent hunters who either are cavemen or Victorian (Lost World) hunters hunting mammoths or dinosaurs.&#10;The rules are tongue-and-cheek and easy to follow.&#10;Solitaire play is facilitated by the system's animal reaction tables which detail how an animal reacts to certain actions by the player(s.)&#10;Three basic scenarios are included in the rules.&#10;&#10;","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":8,"minPlayTime":10,"maxPlayTime":10,"minAge":10,"categoriesAndMechanics":["Adventure","Animals","Dice","Fighting","Miniatures","Prehistoric","Science Fiction","Wargame","Action Points","Cooperative Game","Dice Rolling"],"rating":3.665625,"complexity":1,"urlThumb":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/uwoKnvArIITUfVIu8zRNRg__thumb/img/PiidVdMPoe1qs9J8OtZpRgZC7_U=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1458252.png","urlImage":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/uwoKnvArIITUfVIu8zRNRg__original/img/ieqgFC22fxvOg4cVBngKL0_tcQo=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic1458252.png"},{"bggId":"23217","name":"Das Hamburg-Spiel","description":"You roll and move around the city of Hamburg, Germany, answering questions about the history of the city and scoring points.&#10;&#10;","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":6,"minPlayTime":45,"maxPlayTime":45,"minAge":12,"categoriesAndMechanics":["Travel","Trivia","Roll / Spin and Move"],"rating":1.75,"complexity":0,"urlThumb":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/tuc1F6MuWGMBkJZUMtVbpw__thumb/img/IdhcUnQ6hD6Psm1uvDWJLmnz4bc=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic171590.jpg","urlImage":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/tuc1F6MuWGMBkJZUMtVbpw__original/img/PCr_XqESrCddzMKAx9KnDPKrmYc=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic171590.jpg"},{"bggId":"23218","name":"Farb-Karussell","description":"The game consists of four circular boards, one for each player, each with ten colorful items pictured in the center and 10 positions for discs around the edge.

They are also used in the &quot;Opinion of...&quot;-squares, for example &quot;In the opinion of men, female bodybuilders are sexy?&quot; If the majority of other players agree with how the player thinks men and women generally think, they win that card.&#10;&#10;As an elimination/game lengthening feature, there are also 'Black hole'-squares on the board; category gets chosen by opponents and if the player is wrong, they lose ALL categories so far collected, ie. start from the beginning again.&#10;&#10;Once all four categories are collected, player may proceed to the center of the board, where they need to answer one question from each category during the same turn, and get at least one right, in which case they win.&#10;&#10;Questions and answers are sometimes slightly naughty/risque especially in the &quot;Opinion of...&quot;-categories, hence the high age limit.&#10;&#10;","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":6,"minPlayTime":60,"maxPlayTime":60,"minAge":16,"categoriesAndMechanics":["Party Game","Trivia","Roll / Spin and Move"],"rating":1.791665,"complexity":0,"urlThumb":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/lWCnTr1sAvUXdjoO3_Xoaw__thumb/img/3Fo4bp62QthA5SuP7K2QzHoVdUs=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic4453965.jpg","urlImage":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/lWCnTr1sAvUXdjoO3_Xoaw__original/img/xCVF-icmZWF2k9sATcG8GWMjLfw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4453965.jpg"},{"bggId":"23238","name":"Hullabaloo","description":"This 1966 game from REMCO was based on the televison show of the same name that appeared from Apr 12, 1965 to April 11, 1966.
