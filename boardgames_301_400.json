You do this by trying to land on M*A*S*H spaces where you can collect wounded and chopper parts.  But be careful, some of the M*A*S*H cards on the M*A*S*H spaces can hinder your rescue mission.  The supply depot can help you complete your chopper so you can make a speedy escape to the chopper pad and send your wounded safely home.

Most of the time, they have to pay money, which is usually gained from the &quot;Pay Day&quot; space.  Players can also buy businesses and earn income from other players who land on those spaces.  Loans can be taken if money is insufficient, but too many loans lead to bankruptcy, which will hurt a player's final score.&#10;&#10;Blessings, used for scoring, are mostly gained by achieving accomplishments.  Most accomplishments (getting a diploma, attending church, etc) are gained by landing on the spaces required.  Some require players to have visited another space (e.g. to get married, one must land on &quot;BYU Square&quot;, pay $15,000, then proceed to the &quot;Temple Square&quot;).&#10;&#10;When landing on a Spice of Life space, players draw a card and follow the instructions printed, which can be beneficial or detrimental.  Some cards offer choices: a player can either gain cash or Blessings, or possibly mull over which to sacrifice.&#10;&#10;Blessings are scored for a player when he or she lands on the &quot;Interview Square&quot;.  The game ends when a player has three Interviews; the player with the highest total score (from three Interviews) is the winner.&#10;&#10;The 1985 version by Ungame is simpler in design.  It has fewer spaces on the board and does not have events that require players to track to different spaces to gain Blessings.  The first player to obtain a Gospel card (obtained by landing on a square) and have at least 50 Blessings (the number can be adjusted on agreement) wins and ends the game.&#10;&#10;","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":6,"minPlayTime":20,"maxPlayTime":20,"minAge":0,"categoriesAndMechanics":["Religious","Roll / Spin and Move","Set Collection"],"rating":2.8,"complexity":0,"urlThumb":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/P7sUMal2YroE1ZcGBtDQQA__thumb/img/cogAdjiTNTO2SLfGZC8UpT5p7yU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic254607.jpg","urlImage":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/P7sUMal2YroE1ZcGBtDQQA__original/img/YVcphkU7wEVyyFO36HZXkhjGLWc=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic254607.jpg"},{"bggId":"9758","name":"Uniquely New Jersey","description":"Be the first player to completely fill the state-shaped scoring map by correctly answering questions at five of the six key cities, and then answering a question correctly at Trenton.&#10;&#10;","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"minPlayTime":30,"maxPlayTime":30,"minAge":0,"categoriesAndMechanics":["Educational","Memory","Trivia","Memory"],"rating":1.333335,"complexity":0,"urlThumb":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/snY51KbSZbMYI8wDZIGQ1w__thumb/img/qhbTQNxplBhvFSauIOax1HuMUhU=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic40622.jpg","urlImage":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/snY51KbSZbMYI8wDZIGQ1w__original/img/I_HlUGe4Y_4ONQ7nidRwT103wdY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic40622.jpg"},{"bggId":"9760","name":"Telephone Tag","description":"Object is to be the first player to reach your location with three messages from your boyfriend.

These are games that both teenage and older players can enjoy.  Having military experience is no advantage-- the methods of play are definite, decisive and easily mastered.&quot;&#10;&#10;The game board, while rudimentary, includes rivers, mountains, high ridges, railroads, roads, streams, towns and cities.  Each side has a number of counters representing infantry, artillery, cavalry, locomotives and headquarters, each with varying strength and movement capabilities.  The pieces are identified by number only (i.e., an infantry piece has a #4 on its face, and an artillery piece has a #2).  Movement is affected by terrain, as is battle strength.  The Union army wins the main game by retaining control of Chattanooga and capturing Atlanta.  The Confederates win by holding Atlanta.&#10;&#10;The game is interesting in part because of its publication date.  There wasn't much competition for Avalon Hill in the early 60s, but fans of Avalon Hill's early games will immediately recognize elements of this one.&#10;&#10;","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":2,"minPlayTime":120,"maxPlayTime":120,"minAge":12,"categoriesAndMechanics":["American Civil War","Wargame","Dice Rolling","Simulation","Square Grid"],"rating":3.5,"complexity":2.5,"urlThumb":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/6-fFZeVtGs7QDt7I37UcRQ__thumb/img/q7Kcnz45QwTx4AEBcms-Ozj2pTI=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic40906.jpg","urlImage":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/6-fFZeVtGs7QDt7I37UcRQ__original/img/l-lOe9_PKfautopXrcSdGytLdnw=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic40906.jpg"},{"bggId":"9830","name":"Moskitojagd","description":"Childs dexterity game with a electronic, spinning card dealer and 4 swatters with suction cups on the ends.
