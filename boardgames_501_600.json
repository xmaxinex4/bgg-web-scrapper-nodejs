Each player gets four ingredients on his hand and tries to build delicious burgers which get high scores. But hey, what's that? There's a tick between the ingredients. Try to get rid of it as fast as possible. Put it in a burger and hope that no one notices. Fortunately you also can put it in an opponent's burger. But he may give you his burger then and you mustn't refuse that nice 'gift'.&#10;Bluff: Place your ingredients face-down on the table. So no one knows if it's cheese, salad, onions or a little tick. When your opponent gives you that burger, you'll get extra-score. Find the right strategy and the right face-expression to convince your opponents. When the cards are turned face-up, it's getting funny. Tick-Burger is a funny mixture of strategy, chance and bluff for the whole family.&quot;&#10;&#10;","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"minPlayTime":30,"maxPlayTime":30,"minAge":0,"categoriesAndMechanics":["Bluffing","Card Game","Humor","Set Collection"],"rating":0,"complexity":0,"urlThumb":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/yyoy-cEI5tpZkDl4EqgOXg__thumb/img/TFYuFiV7Whv455hc76rs136jfok=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic315354.jpg","urlImage":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/yyoy-cEI5tpZkDl4EqgOXg__original/img/gSBUL8nYkJvQll6iscWQblDGdDY=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic315354.jpg"},{"bggId":"35422","name":"SuDoku: Die Spielesammlung","description":"SuDoku: Die Spielesammlung is a set of six games which use similar Sudoku-like rules to govern placement of tiles.&#10;&#10;In each game, players have identical sets of tiles (numbered 1-9 multiple times) and each turn play one which is randomly drawn. Certain defined sections of the board can only have one of each number in them. When each of certain small sections of the board is filled, the tiles for each player in the section are totaled and points given for first and second place. Bonus points are also given for players who complete larger board sections. The sections which define the placement constraints, regular scoring, and bonus scoring vary from game to game.&#10;&#10;The six games are:&#10;&#10;1.
