Under a share-the-wealth scheme it is proposed that the Government shall make every man a king and give each person an equal share of the money, after which time each must take care of himself. If a man has good luck and is a shrewd manager, he may beat the game of &quot;inflation.&quot; If he isn't, he will be no better off than theretofore and distribution of the wealth of the country will not have availed him anything&quot;.&#10;&#10;&#10;This game is played like modern Monopoly. From Wikipedia: &quot;Inflation board game came to the attention of Parker Brothers management in the 1930s, after they began sales of Monopoly. Copeland continued sales of the latter game after Parker Brothers attempted a patent lawsuit against him. Parker Brothers held the Magie and Darrow patents, but settled with Copeland rather than going to trial, since Copeland was prepared to have witnesses testify that they had played Monopoly before Darrow's &quot;invention&quot; of the game.

Up to five players work together as heroes on missions against the enemies of the Imperium (Solo play is also supported).&#10;&#10;Each new game begins with players choosing from one of six hero archetypes: Assassin, Duelist, Grunt, Medic, Officer, and Psi Mage. Each hero is represented by a Stat card listing his attributes and default abilities/attacks. Each hero also has a deck of Ability cards from which the player can choose up to five. Some Ability cards are marked as &quot;Advanced&quot; and count as two cards. This allows players to choose fewer, but more powerful cards if they wish.&#10;&#10;Once player have chosen their heroes and Ability cards, they select a mission to be played. Each mission description includes which enemies will be encountered and what goals the player must meet to win. An Encounter deck can also be used (especially for solo players) to randomize which enemies will be fought during the mission.&#10;&#10;Each mission also includes a map of the game board. The board consists of several tiles that players assemble prior to the beginning of play. Paper miniatures, representing both heroes and enemies, are placed on the board and moved on a turn-by-turn basis. Each turn allows players to carry out several actions including attacking, movement, and using items. Control of the enemy side is either done by a single player who chose not to have a hero, or by hero players on a rotating basis.&#10;&#10;Enemies in the game are grouped into three main factions: the primitive Ferans, slave-trading Ougluks, and the technologically advanced Warlock Industries.

The New Perfect Match Game is the fun way to find out. The game is played by couples who are asked a series of questions with four alternative answers supplied. These questions cover topics ranging from sex to politics and the arts. Each partner decides on their favourite response and uses the electronic Perfect Match device to check their compatibility and advance along the board. the first couple to reach the Perfect Match Heart Light are the winners. Who will be your Perfect Match?&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;&#10;2 Electronic Perfect Match Devices.&#10;288 Question Cards.&#10;1 Die.&#10;4 Position Markers.&#10;Perfect Match Game Board.&#10;&#10;The players are divided into couples. Each couple takes a position marker and places it in the start square. Remove the perfect match cards from their perforations and place them in their marked positions on the game board.&#10;&#10;The Perfect Match Cards:&#10;These cards are divided into two categories: pink 'Girls' cards and blue 'Guys' cards. As the game proceeds, question cards are taken from the 'Girls' pile if the playing couple lands on a pink square or From the 'Guys' pile if they land on a blue square. Each card contains one questions with four alternative&#10;answers marked A,B,C or D.&#10;&#10;Choosing the right answer:&#10;If the couple lands on a blue square, one of the other players picks up a 'Guys' card and directs one question on it to the male partner. He must choose the alternative which he feels is most appropriate to him. His partner must try to anticipate his feelings or attitudes on that question and choose the same alternative. Couples should be open and honest in their choice of answer. Similarly, if the couple lands on a pink square, a 'Girls' card would be taken and its question directed towards the female partner. She will choose and answer and her partner should try to anticipate this response.&#10;&#10;Questions marked 'BOTH' are  designed to test compatibility, with each partner choosing their own favourite answer in response to the question asked.&#10;&#10;Using the Electronic Perfect Match device:&#10;These devices are in the shape of four hearts joined together. Each heart is labeled A,B,C or D, representing the four alternatives on the Perfect Match question cards. When a question is asked and each partner has silently decided on which alternative to choose, they each hold up their device with the chosen representative letter uppermost. They must not allow each other to see their choices. The two devices are then pressed together. If the electronic tone sounds, a perfect match has been achieved for that question.&#10;&#10;Dare Cards:&#10;Scattered throughout both packs of cards are Dare Cards. If one these cards appears, the couple must perform whatever is required of them according to the instructions on the card. Their performance is adequate (as indicated by a show of hands) then the couple may roll the die again and continue their turn. Be warned - if you are too easy on others then there is no challenge to perform well. If you are too tough, then your opponent will be equally tough on you. So be fair!&#10;&#10;Playing the game: Each couple rolls the die once and those with the highest score start, moving their marker the corresponding number of squares. One of the other players then reads the first question to the starting couple. If the couple achieves a Perfect Match, they roll the die again and advance the corresponding number of squares along the board. Remember, a couple can only roll the die and advance after  they have successfully answered a Perfect Match question or performed a Dare task. The couple continues in this way until they are unsuccessful in either a Perfect Match question or a Dare performance, in which case the control of the game is handed over to the next couple (moving clockwise).&#10;&#10;Winning the Game:&#10;The first couple to reach the Perfect Match Heart Light and then successfully achieve a Perfect Match from their Choice of either a Girls or Guys question will be declared the winner.&#10;&#10;&#10;    Special Note&#10;&#10;&#10;Should the electronic tone stop working use a nail file or a similar tool to lever apart the two case sections of the blue device.

The winner is the player who is the first to get both meeples to the landing area.&#10;  &#10;The game was published in the 1950s.&#10;&#10;","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"minPlayTime":0,"maxPlayTime":0,"minAge":0,"categoriesAndMechanics":["Science Fiction","Space Exploration","Point to Point Movement"],"rating":0,"complexity":0,"urlThumb":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/mhLogTyDT_oV2CcK1LWOVw__thumb/img/2HKeP4EoAHvQKHqTJL8HokiunYA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1881483.jpg","urlImage":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/mhLogTyDT_oV2CcK1LWOVw__original/img/XiJrGYbujf2bXpXeYwy7BJU-VvA=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1881483.jpg"},{"bggId":"152703","name":"Quad Kingdom Chess","description":"Quad Kingdom Chess is a chess variant for two to four players, utilizing a standard chess board with two rows added to each side (called a Kingdom) for the players' starting positions, and with a line of pawn promotion much drawn between squares six rows out from each Kingdom.

Four squares of empty space at each corner of the board are called Towers and are not in the field of play.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to force an opponent's King into Checkmate.

To accomplish this, the players have to search for gold and steal tents from each other. The tents are moved by the roll of a die. If a tent reaches a space with an opposing tent, it's put over this tent and has captured it. Captured tents can be freed by the same maneuver. Freed and captured tents can be secured or released by taking them to one's base camp. Tents arriving at the gold claim at the center of the board get one goldnugget. For 3 nuggets a player can get a captured tent back.&#10;&#10;","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"minPlayTime":0,"maxPlayTime":0,"minAge":0,"categoriesAndMechanics":["American West","Roll / Spin and Move"],"rating":0,"complexity":0,"urlThumb":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/a6DgpEC5FmnmfuDPhfRdFw__thumb/img/aXdT5npFbf-TottYusT5nwEFY60=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1903904.jpg","urlImage":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/a6DgpEC5FmnmfuDPhfRdFw__original/img/DdtBE_LRIxP8PXXsdEBd8qltL7Y=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1903904.jpg"},{"bggId":"152709","name":"Tippin' Toadstool","description":"From box:&#10;&#10;TUMBLIN' FUMBLIN' FUN!&#10;It's fun, it's unpredictable...
