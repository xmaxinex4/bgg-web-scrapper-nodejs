The images are all innocent pictures of animals, check them out in our picture gallery! No animals were hurt in the making of the Go Hunt card game.&#10;&#10;Game play: With four or less players; seven cards are dealt to each player.  Five cards can be dealt to each player in larger groups.  The remaining cards are placed face down in a draw pile.  The player left of the dealer goes first.  On your turn, ask any player for a specific card.  For example: &quot;Michele do you have little hooters?&quot;  You must already hold one of the requested cards.  If Michele has any little hooter cards she must give them all to you.  If the person you ask does not have the card you requested, they would say &quot;Go Hunt!&quot;  You would then draw a card from the draw pile.  When the draw pile runs out, keep playing until all the cards have been made into matching sets.  When you collect a set of matching cards, immediately show the other players and place the cards face down in front of you.&#10;&#10;Is is fair to lump all pair matching games together?

Since a player has to get two pieces into the goal, the dynamic shifts from just trying to get a single piece into a goal.

The player whose turn it is gets to topple the dominoes by pushing the first domino in the line. First, though, the other players have to predict whether or not the entire line of dominoes will fall.&#10;&#10;After predictions have been made, the first domino is toppled. If the entire line falls, then the toppling player receives a gift token, as well as any player who made the right prediction; if some dominoes remain standing, the players who predicted that receive a gift token.&#10;&#10;After six rounds, the game ends, and the player who has gained the most gift tokens wins.&#10;&#10;In the expert version of the game, various contraptions for connecting two lines of dominoes are included, and in each round, one of these is included in the line of dominoes connecting the start and destination.&#10;&#10;","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"minPlayTime":30,"maxPlayTime":30,"minAge":5,"categoriesAndMechanics":["Children's Game","Educational"],"rating":3.0875,"complexity":0,"urlThumb":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/GUgD6Ia1DUPml2HzGgnnaQ__thumb/img/gyp0MsuyDe1jiTe-XiFqnV9jacw=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1203498.jpg","urlImage":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/GUgD6Ia1DUPml2HzGgnnaQ__original/img/Rt03bv2Z7Hl_ObfWUTctBwzJgo8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1203498.jpg"},{"bggId":"117954","name":"Das Bibel Quiz","description":"Objective: improve your knowledge about the Bible - Old &amp; New Testament&#10; - acting/moving by turn -&#10;roll the die, move, draw a card, get the correct answer&#10;&#10;","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":5,"minPlayTime":25,"maxPlayTime":25,"minAge":9,"categoriesAndMechanics":["Card Game","Dice","Religious","Trivia","Dice Rolling","Open Drafting"],"rating":0.5,"complexity":0,"urlThumb":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fL_ya3Xq55igEnqEAqr1XA__thumb/img/LRwk_gGGre8QguyjBb4SHhSg0TA=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1207798.png","urlImage":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/fL_ya3Xq55igEnqEAqr1XA__original/img/YhVw1iUSoU54qZLwRysuncWIB6U=/0x0/filters:format(png)/pic1207798.png"},{"bggId":"117955","name":"Das Quiz der Schlager & Volksmusik","description":"Objective: move to finish line knowing correct answers on questions out of the world of German Schlager music&#10; - moving/acting by turn -&#10;roll the die, move forward, draw a correspondent card, find correct answer (out of 4 - multiple choice); questions like (samples):&#10;Andrea Berg was married with?

The British attempted to reduce a poorly-defended German salient centered on the town of Neuve Chapelle. Plans were to expand a breakthrough and with cavalry and infantry reserves take the Aubers ridge line. However, poor communication and coordination and the weather conspired to slow the initial British successes and allowed the German army to rush reinforcements into the area. Among other game features, designer Michael W. Kennedy uses offensive artillery and defensive artillery fire, British command checks, and a unique assault combat mechanic to simulate the bloody struggle. (Sourced from the White Dog Games website.)&#10;&#10;The game is played over a series of 14 turns which represent the three days of The Battle of Neuve Chapelle. Each day is divided into four turns with a separate night turn in between. During the day turns, both sides will fire artillery (weather permitting), move, and attack. During the night turns, both sides will dig in new trenches on the new front lines.&#10;&#10;The game simulates early trench warfare and makes prominent use of artillery and the defensive advantages of trenches. Weather conditions and British communications among the four divisions are determined randomly each turn. Each assault phase contains a defensive artillery and defensive combat phase, making defense a major component of the game.&#10;&#10;There are several hexes that have victory point values. The British win by controlling as many of these hexes as possible. The Germans win by preventing the British from achieving this objectives.&#10;&#10;","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":2,"minPlayTime":120,"maxPlayTime":120,"minAge":0,"categoriesAndMechanics":["Print & Play","Wargame","World War I","Hexagon Grid"],"rating":3.135295,"complexity":3,"urlThumb":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/wKrCZr_ZKlD4V5T-Ypw2hg__thumb/img/f9XDF_iTtidF3TJ2ApSa3SL6F34=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic1303986.jpg","urlImage":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/wKrCZr_ZKlD4V5T-Ypw2hg__original/img/-8gsMXo67FMjfvcEhAme2kR3ndE=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic1303986.jpg"},{"bggId":"117984","name":"The One True King","description":"The King is dead and three powerful Lords vie for the throne.
